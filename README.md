# Server
### Node.js server - light, compact, easily usable and moddable ###
As it is it contains my website/data for testing purposes, they will be removed as soon as the server is ready.
Server is well documented and each folder contains a README explaining its purpose

to run the server just type "node server.js" in the command prompt

from simplicity comes security - you won't have to worry about your server being so unnecessarily complicated that you will miss a hidden page/feature that gives malicious users access to your server's information. Keep it simple, you don't have to be a security expert to safely operate this server.

###Features:
+ fast setup, intuitive
+ little knowledge required to operate
+ no filetypes required in URL to access page (/webpage works just as well as /webpage.html)
+ can be taken down and restarted in seconds
+ no services, hidden sites or admin panels running without your knowledge
+ not a mainstream server, so no known security vulnerabilities
+ integrated tokens so different types of users can access different types of content
+ SSL available
+ handles bad input
