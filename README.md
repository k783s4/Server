# Server
### Node.js server - light, compact, easily usable and moddable ###
As it is it contains my website/data for testing purposes, they will be removed as soon as the server is ready.
Server is well documented and each folder contains a README explaining its purpose

to run the server just type "node server.js" in the command prompt

from simplicity comes security - you won´t have to worry that your server is so unnecessarily complicated that you will miss a hidden feature that gives malicious users access to your server´s information. Keep it simple, you won´t have to be a security specialist to safely operate this server.
